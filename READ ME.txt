"Calcium-Imaging-master.zip" contains all Matlab code used for motion correction of raw calcium 
imaging movies, and the segmentation and thresholding of dentate gyrus cells to extract calcium 
traces. To use, unzip the archived directory, add the installation directory to Matlab path, 
and run "aRunner." Matlab will initialize a GUI that permits you to load a raw calcium imaging 
movie (.tif) with or without running data (.mat) used for motion correction. All calcium imaging
files contained in the associated manuscript are included. Raw calcium imaging movies are named
accordingly with the following prefixes: "NoDGinj ..." for retroAAV only experiments in Figure 
4, "Virus ..." and "Saline ..." used for AAV1 co-injected animals in Supplementary Figure 4. 
TIF files are raw calcium imaging videos to be loaded into aRUNNER and MAT files ending with 
"...running [1-1].mat" as running files.

Each calcium imaging video comes with "Data" folder of results obtained using aRUNNER. 
This includes:
"[experiment] M# motionCut_Output.mat" data structure with motion corrected video
"[experiment] M# segOutput clear reference image.png" image showing maximum projection 
with cell segmentation
"[experiment] M# segOutput.mat" data structure that contains segmented video
"[experiment] M# .fig" showing correlation of motion and non-motion corrected video 
to reference image.
"[experiment] M# .mat" data structure as final output of aRUNNER motion correction and 
segmentation.
"[experiment] M# intensity data.mat" data structure that contains calcium traces as deltaF/F 
and as binary firing

aRunner will also provide a ".txt" which contains data summary of: movie duration, threshold 
factor, mean intensity for all cells, average neg std deviation, lowest and highest neg std 
dev, size neg std deviation, average amplitude per event, lowest and highest amplitude, 
average area under curve per event - used in the manuscript.

"ExtractDataFromCalciumAnalysisFiles.m" loads "[experiment] M# intensity data.mat" files and 
provides data summary of: Total events,  average cells per minute, percent active cells, 
percent active cells per minute, number of events per minute, num events per minute per active 
cell - used in manuscript. 
NOTE: aRunner can provide some of these metrics, but  parameters in 
"ExtractDataFromCalciumAnalysisFiles.m" were used for the extraction of these data in the manuscript.
